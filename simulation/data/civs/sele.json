The whole region from Phrygia to the Indus was subject to Seleucus. â€” Appian, 'The Syrian Wars'."

The rebellious eastern satraps of Bactria and Parthia were brought to heel , temporarily securing his eastern borders. He then turned his attention to mother Greece, attempting to fulfill the dreams of his fathers by invading Greece under the pretext of liberation. The Achaean League and the Kingdom of Pergamon banded together with the Romans to defeat him at the Battle of Magnesia, forever burying the dream of reuniting Alexander's empire."

Originally named Mithridates, he assumed the name Antiochus either upon his accession to the throne or after the death of his elder brother Antiochus. Notable events during his reign include the near-conquest of Egypt (twice), which was halted by the threat of Roman intervention, and the beginning of the Jewish revolt of the Maccabees. He died of sudden illness while fighting off a Parthian invasion from the East."
